      <p>Hey, my name is Steve. I'm currently a senior at Abby Kelley. If I could describe myself with a few words, I'd
        say I'm methodical and ambitious. I really like to plan things out and learn new things that can are very, very
        useful (I was overjoyed when I saw the Pandas library). I constantly flip through the "I'm a genius" and "I'm an
        imposter" stage when I code. </p>
      <p>I'm think I'm pretty good at coding (I've only
        learned Python + a bit of web development), and I kind of like it (I don't want to learn physics and be a
        hardware engineer nooooo :C ), but I could definitely get better. It kind of makes me sad some times, though. <a
          href="https://github.com/Thy-boi">Oh also take a look at my github, too.</a>
      </p>

      <h5>Some of the things I like to do include:</h3>

          <li>Coding (I really like using VS code, too)</li>
          <li>Mostly learning new things</li>

      <p>The main reason why I got into computers was because I played them when I was a kid. While my parents wanted me
        to become a doctor, I boldy claimed that I could become a computer engineer. But, like I mentioned above, I
        decided to software engineer because it's way cooler, easier, and much more accessible to me.</p>

        Also, Python is sincerely BASED and a very NICE beginning language to work with (Yes, I know it's not the best
        and strongest but it's a pleasure to use). I like using it so much, that I decided to add some of it in my AA
        Math IA for analysing some stocks (hehe).

      <p>
        One of the things I've dabbled in my 17 years of living was Photoshop. I really only did this for fun and not
        for a career(I was beyond fascinated on seeing colors changing on an image).
